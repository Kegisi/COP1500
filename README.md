# COP1500 Integration Project
- Dennis Kerry
- Professor Michael Osheroff
- 2023 Spring

!!! In order for my Integration Project to properly run in Pycharm, you must Modify Run Configuration -> Check Emulate terminal in output console !!!
Alternatively, you could just run main.py directly using a python interpreter

This program simulates the terminal emulation of the GUI of early games such as NetHack and Rogue. Also, upon collision with an Orc (represented by an o), the program will generate mathematical evaluations based on user integer input.
